[slowly] Back then... [chuckles] we had no phones—just dirt roads, radio songs, and big dreams. [whispers] I kissed her under the old elm by Miller’s Creek, swore I’d never leave. [coughs] But then the war came, and youth slipped through my fingers like smoke. [chuckles] Funny... how a moment can last forever... even when everything else fades.


So... you wish to reconstruct a soul?

Survival mode. The dirt tastes bitter.

Just enough to starve slowly.

Mediocrity. Safe, but boring.

Comfortable. You forgot how to run.


The golden parachute. Don't choke.

A doormat. Everyone wipes their feet.

Weak knees. You want to kneel.

A healthy ego. How common.

Nose high. You will drown in rain.

Stiff neck. Perfect for hanging.

Blind. Blissfully ignorant.

You see what they want you to see.

You see the chaos. Can you handle it?

Stone heart. Nothing hurts.

Exposed nerves. Breathing hurts.
